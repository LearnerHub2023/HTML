            Chess, one of the oldest and most popular board games, played by two opponents on a checkered board with specially designed pieces of contrasting colours, 
            commonly white and black. White moves first, after which the players alternate turns in accordance with fixed rules, each player attempting to force the 
            opponent’s principal piece, the King, into checkmate—a position where it is unable to avoid capture.

            Chess first appeared in India about the 6th century AD and by the 10th century had spread from Asia to the Middle East and Europe. Since at least the 
            15th century, chess has been known as the “royal game” because of its popularity among the nobility. Rules and set design slowly evolved until both 
            reached today’s standard in the early 19th century. Once an intellectual diversion favoured by the upper classes, chess went through an explosive growth 
            in interest during the 20th century as professional and state-sponsored players competed for an officially recognized world championship title and 
            increasingly lucrative tournament prizes. Organized chess tournaments, postal correspondence games, and Internet chess now attract men, women, 
            and children around the world.

            Carrom is a board game that is somewhat similar to billiards or snooker but it is not played by balls and sticks. It is very much popular in most of the 
            South East Asian countries like	
                •	Pakistan
                •	Bangladesh

                •	Japan
                •	Malaysia
                •	Indonesia.
            There are carrom cafes in these countries and they regularly organize carrom competitions.
            Apart from Asian countries, carrom board game gain popularity in Europe and North America too.
            Countries like Italy, UK, France, Germany, Greece, Spain, Switzerland, etc. also formed their carrom federations. Even Australia and the United States have 
            picked up the like of Carrom and is growing rapidly amongst the citizens.

                Table tennis, also known as ping-pong and whiff-whaff, is a racket sport derived from tennis but distinguished by its playing surface being atop a stationary table, 
                rather than the court on which players stand. Either individually or in teams of two, players take alternating turns returning a light, hollow ball over the table's 
                net onto the opposing half of the court using small rackets until they fail to do so, which results in a point for the opponent. Play is fast, requiring quick reaction
                and constant attention, and is characterized by an emphasis on spin relative to other ball sports, which can heavily affect the ball's trajectory.
                Owed to its small minimum playing area, its ability to be played indoors in all climates, and relative accessibility of equipment, table tennis is enjoyed worldwide not
                just as a competitive sport, but as a common recreational pastime among players of all levels and ages.
                Table tennis has been an Olympic sport since 1988,[3] with event categories in both men's and women's singles, and men's and women's teams since replacing doubles in 2008.
                Table tennis is governed by the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), founded in 1926, and specifies the official rules in the ITTF handbook.ITTF currently includes
                226 member associations worldwide.

                    Ludo is one of the most popular games in India. However, have you ever wondered about the exact origin of this legendary game? The exact origin of this game comes from 
                    the historic Ellora Caves present in Maharashtra.
                    This board game was depicted as a form of illustration on the wall.
                    Thus, from here, it was concluded that Ludo was an Indian creation.
                    Since then, people have played similar forms of the how to play ludo game, which we call Ludo.
                    There were different mediums on which Ludo was played such as cloths, slate, and board.
                    However, now Ludo can be played virtually as well.
                    There are many applications where one can play Ludo virtually from remote locations.
                    Over the past few years, Ludo has been known in many names in Indian history like ‘Chaucer’, ‘Chopad’, ‘Pachisi’.
                    However, with time the game became famous all over the world.
                    The Spanish version of this game is known as ‘Parcheesi’, whereas the name ‘Chatush Pada’ knows the Chinese version of Ludo.
                    On the other hand, Ludo is known by the name ‘Ludu’ in Africa.

        Cricket, England's national summer sport, which is now played throughout the world, particularly in Australia, India, Pakistan, the West Indies, and the British Isles.

        Cricket is played with a bat and ball and involves two competing sides (teams) of 11 players. The field is oval with a rectangular area in the middle, known as the pitch,
        that is 22 yards (20.12 metres) by 10 feet (3.04 metres) wide. Two sets of three sticks, called wickets, are set in the ground at each end of the pitch. Across the top of
        each wicket lie horizontal pieces called bails. The sides take turns at batting and bowling (pitching); each turn is called an “innings” (always plural). Sides have one or
        two innings each, depending on the prearranged duration of the match, the object being to score the most runs. The bowlers, delivering the ball with a straight arm, try to 
        break (hit) the wicket with the ball so that the bails fall. This is one of several ways that the batsman is dismissed, or put out. A bowler delivers six balls at one wicket
        (thus completing an “over”), then a different player from his side bowls six balls to the opposite wicket. The batting side defends its wicket.
    
        There are two batsman up at a time, and the batsman being bowled to (the striker) tries to hit the ball away from the wicket. A hit may be defensive or offensive. 
        A defensive hit may protect the wicket but leave the batsmen no time to run to the opposite wicket. In that case the batsmen need not run, and play will resume with
        another bowl. If the batsman can make an offensive hit, he and the second batsman (the nonstriker) at the other wicket change places. Each time both batsmen can reach
        the opposite wicket, one run is scored. Providing they have enough time without being caught out and dismissed, the batsmen may continue to cross back and forth between
        the wickets, earning an additional run for each time both reach the opposite side. There is an outside boundary around the cricket field. A ball hit to or beyond the 
        boundary scores four points if it hits the ground and then reaches the boundary, six points if it reaches the boundary from the air (a fly ball). The team with the 
        highest number of runs wins a match. Should both teams be unable to complete their number of innings before the time allotted, the match is declared a draw. Scores 
        in the hundreds are common in cricket.
    
        Matches in cricket can range from informal weekend afternoon encounters on village greens to top-level international contests spread over five days in Test matches 
        and played by leading professional players in grand stadiums.

            volleyball, game played by two teams, usually of six players on a side, in which the players use their hands to bat a ball back and forth over a high net, trying 
            to make the ball touch the court within the opponents’ playing area before it can be returned. To prevent this a player on the opposing team bats the ball up and 
            toward a teammate before it touches the court surface—that teammate may then volley it back across the net or bat it to a third teammate who volleys it across 
            the net. A team is allowed only three touches of the ball before it must be returned over the net.

            Football, also called association football or soccer, game in which two teams of 11 players, using any part of their bodies except their hands and arms, try to maneuver 
            the ball into the opposing team’s goal. Only the goalkeeper is permitted to handle the ball and may do so only within the penalty area surrounding the goal. 
            The team that scores more goals wins.
            Football is the world’s most popular ball game in numbers of participants and spectators. Simple in its principal rules and essential equipment, the sport can be played 
            almost anywhere, from official football playing fields (pitches) to gymnasiums, streets, school playgrounds, parks, or beaches. Football’s governing body, the Fédération 
            Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), estimated that at the turn of the 21st century there were approximately 250 million football players and over 1.3 billion 
            people “interested” in football; in 2010 a combined television audience of more than 26 billion watched football’s premier tournament, the quadrennial month-long World Cup finals.

            Golf, a cross-country game in which a player strikes a small ball with various clubs from a series of starting points (teeing grounds) into a series of holes on a course. 
            The player who holes his ball in the fewest strokes wins. The origins of the game are difficult to ascertain, although evidence now suggests that early forms of golf were 
            played in the Netherlands first and then in Scotland. From a somewhat obscure antiquity, the game attained worldwide popularity, especially in the 20th century. Nothing is 
            known about the early game’s favourite venues on the European continent, but in Scotland golf was first played on seaside links with their crisp turf and natural hazards. 
            Only later in the game’s evolution did play on downs, moorland, and parkland courses begin. Golfers participate at every level, from a recreational game to popular televised 
            professional tournaments. Despite its attractions, golf is not a game for everyone; it requires a high degree of skill that is honed only with great patience and dedication.

            Field hockey, also called hockey, outdoor game played by two opposing teams of 11 players each who use sticks curved at the striking end to hit a small, hard ball into their 
            opponent’s goal. It is called field hockey to distinguish it from the similar game played on ice.
            Hockey is believed to date from the earliest civilizations. The Arabs, Greeks, Persians, and Romans each had their own versions, and traces of a stick game played by the Aztec 
            Indians of South America have been found. Hockey can also be identified with other early games, such as hurling and shinty. During the Middle Ages a French stick game called 
            hoquet was played, and the English word may be derived from it.
            Hockey began to be played in English schools in the late 19th century, and the first men’s hockey club, at Blackheath in southeastern London, recorded a minute book in 1861. 
            Teddington, another London club, introduced several major variations, including the ban of using hands or lifting sticks above the shoulder, the replacement of the rubber cube 
            by a sphere as the ball, and most importantly, the adopting of a striking circle, which was incorporated into the rules of the newly founded Hockey Association in London in 1886.
            The British army was largely responsible for spreading the game, particularly in India and the Far East. International competition began in 1895. By 1928 hockey had become India’s 
            national game, and in the Olympic Games that year the Indian team, competing for the first time, won the gold medal without conceding a goal in five matches. It was the start of 
            India’s domination of the sport, an era that ended only with the emergence of Pakistan in the late 1940s. The call for more international matches led to the introduction in 1971 
            of the World Cup. Other major international tournaments include the Asian Cup, Asian Games, European Cup, and Pan-American Games. Men’s field hockey was included in the Olympic 
            Games in 1908 and 1920 and then permanently from 1928. Indoor hockey, played by teams of six players with six interchanging substitutes, has become popular in Europe.
            Despite the restrictions on sports for ladies during the Victorian era, hockey became increasingly popular among women. Although women’s teams had played regular friendly games
            since 1895, serious international competition did not begin until the 1970s. The first Women’s World Cup was held in 1974, and women’s hockey became an Olympic event in 1980. 
            The international governing body, the International Federation of Women’s Hockey Associations, was formed in 1927. The game was introduced into the United States in 1901 by 
            Constance M.K. Applebee, and field hockey subsequently became a popular outdoor team sport among women there, being played in schools, colleges, and clubs.
            The game is played by two teams of 11 players on a rectangular ground. The field is 100 yards (91.4 metres) long and 60 yards (55 metres) wide, and it is marked with a centre 
            line and two 25-yard lines. The goals are 4 yards (3.66 metres) wide and 7 feet (2.13 metres) high. For a goal (which counts for one point) to be scored, the ball must go into 
            the goal and, while within the shooting circle (semicircle), must have been touched by the stick of an attacker. The ball was originally a cricket ball (cork centre, string-wound, 
            and covered with leather), but plastic balls are also approved. It is about 9 inches (23 cm) in circumference. The stick is usually 36 to 38 inches (about 1 metre) long and weighs 
            12 to 28 ounces (340 to 790 grams). Only the flat left side of the stick may be used to strike the ball.
